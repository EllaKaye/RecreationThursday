# Inspired by Max Bill for #RecreationThursday

[#RecreationThursday](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday) is a social project for data visualization folks to recreate and remix existing art pieces through any medium of their choosing - code, painting, music, embroidery, whatever! 

On June 1st, 2022, the piece of art chosen for the project was the cover page of the book 'die grafischen reihen' by Max Bill, as in the image below.

![die grafischen Reihen by Max Bill is a series of overlaid and brightly colored polygons, starting with an octagon and decreasing by one side per layer until reaching a final triangle layer on top. The polygons are colored purple, orange, blue, green, red, and yellow, going from the base octogon to top-layer triangle, respectively. The piece is in the center of an off-white background. It is a book cover - there is minimal typography surrounding the piece, all lower case, with the artist's name in the upper-left, the title in the upper-right, and the publisher, verlag gerd hatje, in small type in the center-bottom.](www/Max Bill - die grafischen reihen.jpeg)

I was drawn to the combination of the geometry and the colours, so decided to participate (for the first time) in #RecreationThursday. The more I worked on it, the more my original plan (a straight-up recreation) expanded. The final result is this two-ways interactive version, my first Shiny app.
